# Learn C++
Hello and welcome to my learning repository, which I consolidate all of my learning and experiences (and frustrations) with the C++ programming language.

I'm currently following the [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) tutorials. Even though, I already know most of the basic concepts of the language, I tought it would be a good idea to have a fresh start from the very beggining. I do recommend this to anyone, as from my personal experience, you never know enough (as I didn't know about list initialization, for instance).

You might see a lot of CMake and other CI-related files. That comes from a template which I inherited from [Jason Turner](https://github.com/lefticus/cpp_starter_project) `cpp_starter_project`.

Every chapter is split accordingly to the tutorial, so should be straight forward when searching for something specific.

An obvious step after finishing (or during) the [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/) tutorial is to learn what make all of this knowledge useful: algorithms and data structures. So I'm also making here my repository for these topics, all implemented in `C++` (maybe design patterns in the future).

One last thing. Is good to have multiple documentations as references from a best practices perspective and also for the language itself. So, apart from the internet of course, one of my additional references is the [Effective Modern C++](https://www.amazon.com.br/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996) book from Scott Meyers.

Be my guest.
