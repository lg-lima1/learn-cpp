## Section 4

### Step 1: Define the problem that you would like to solve :question:
Here are a few examples:
    - “I want to write a program that will allow me to enter many numbers, then calculates the average.”
    - “I want to write a program that generates a 2d maze and lets the user navigate through it. The user wins if they reach the end.”
    - “I want to write a program that reads in a file of stock prices and predicts whether the stock will go up or down.”

### Step 2: Determine how you are going to solve the problem :question:
Typically, good solutions have the following characteristics:
    - They are straightforward (not overly complicated or confusing).
    - They are well documented (especially around any assumptions being made or limitations).
    - They are built modularly, so parts can be reused or changed later without impacting other parts of the program.
    - They are robust, and can recover or give useful error messages when something unexpected happens.

### Step 3: Write the program :sunglasses:
That's the easy part.

## Section 5

### Step 4: Compiling your source code :computer:
Compiler doing compiler things. But actually, is compiling each `.cpp` file that is a dependency of your program, and generating an `.o` file as an output.

### Step 5: Linking object files and libraries :computer:
Linker doing linker things. But actually, is linking `.o` files, together with standard library and all other libraries that requires, to a single executable.

### Steps 6 & 7: Testing and Debugging :computer:
And that's the fun part
